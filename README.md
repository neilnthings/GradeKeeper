# Grade Keeper (ICS321 Final Project)

GradeKeeper is a web application that lets users input courses they are taking and enter work done in each course.  The application then calculates the users grade for each course, relying on the work entered for each one.

The goal of this assignment is for you to learn and practice how to build a DBMS-backed web application that addresses a realistic problem, practice the software engineering skills of requirement analysis, software design, implementation, and testing.

1. your application must have at least 2 (html) screens.
2. your application should deal with data that needs to be persisted in a DBMS.
3. your application should BOTH write and read data to/from a relational DBMS (noSQL data stores are not allowed).
4. your application must not be a trivial extension of Assignment 3.
5. You are not strictly required to use Java/J2EE/JSF with glassfish and/or derby. You may use the web application you developed in Assignment 3 as a starting point, but obviously, turning in Assignment 3 (or trivial extensions thereof) for this project assignment will get zero credit.
